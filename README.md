# Pulp - Open Source Audio Sample Manager

Pulp is an open source alternative
to [ADSR Sample Manager](https://www.adsrsounds.com/product/software/adsr-sample-manager/). This application allows you
to scan a folder, retrieve audio files, automatically detect the audio key, and organize them effectively. In addition
to being an audio sample management tool, Pulp is also an audio file explorer.

## Features

- Scan a folder and retrieve audio files
- Automatically detect the audio key of each file
- Easily organize and search your audio files
- Modern and user-friendly interface

## Technology

Pulp was developed with [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and SQLite for the back-end
and [Solid-JS](https://github.com/ryansolid/solid) for the front-end.

## Installation and Usage

_CLI cargo commands must be typed in the `src-tauri` folder fortunately there is a npm command that allows us to type
any cargo command from the root `npm run cargo -- <here>`_

example :
`npm run cargo -- prisma generate`
_for the CLI [prisma-client-rust](https://prisma.brendonovich.dev/getting-started/setup)_

**Starter**

- Rename `src-tauri/.env.dist` to `src-tauri/.env` and replace `<user>` in `DATABASE_URL` for macOS (For the other OS
  repect `<app_data_dir>/databases/Database.db` and check
  documentation [here](https://tauri.app/v1/api/js/path/#appdatadir)
  and [there](https://docs.rs/tauri/1.2.4/tauri/struct.PathResolver.html#method.app_data_dir) and
  adjust `<app_data_dir>`).
- Install cargo packages : `npm run cargo -- install`
- Install npm packages : `npm install`
- Push in db first migration : `npm run cargo -- prisma migrate dev --name init`.
- Generate Prisma Rust Client : `npm run cargo -- prisma generate`.
- Command helper for generate prisma client javascript with types : `npm run prisma-js -- generate`
  and `npx prisma studio` if you want see the DB.
- Start dev
  with : `npm run tauri dev` [Tauri Development Cycle](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/development/development-cycle)

_I created this command because unfortunately `prisma-client-rust` did not allow me to generate the javascript client.
So this command is a helper to generate the prisma javascript client and take advantage of the types in the javascript
code._

The VS Code debugging is configured in the `.vscode` folder, you just have to download
the [vscode-lldb](https://github.com/vadimcn/vscode-lldb) extension as
shown [here](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/debugging/vs-code)

The commands will evolve in the future to be more generic
